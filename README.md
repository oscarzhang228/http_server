# HTTP Server + Client Built in Python

Built to learn how HTTP works and built on top of the BSD socket libraryâ€™s TCP sockets.

## Features

### Web Server

- **Request Parsing & Response Generation**
  - Full request-line & header parsing
    - Supported Headers:

  - Response to methods:
    - HEAD: Send headers
    - GET: Send file if it exists
    - POST: Create a new file and write the contents of the request body to it
    - PUT: Overwrite existing file
    - PATCH: Given a range of lines
- **Connection Management**
  - Persistent connections (`keep-alive` / `close`)
  - Socket/read timeouts to prevent hangs
  - Thread-pool worker model for connections

### Web Client
